public - can be accessed from any where
protected - can be accessed with in the class, subclass and same package
default - can be accessed with in the class and the same package
private - can be accessed with that class only


A protected variable can be accessed from the same package or
by the derived classes the same way they access their own members,
but if you create an instance of the super class outside of the package of the superclass,
you wont be able to access it even if you are extending this same superclass
